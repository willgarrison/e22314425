In the shadows of ancient times, beneath the early sun,
Giant footsteps echoed, where the rivers run.
Majestic beasts roamed far and wide, in a world so grand,
Mighty dinosaurs, ruling over the land.

With scales that shimmered like jewels under the sky so vast,
Each day a new adventure, a link to the distant past.
From the soaring heights of the pterosaurs, to the depths where the sea reptiles swam,
The earth trembled under their weight, a symphony, a powerful jam.

Oh, in a world lost beneath our feet,
Dinosaurs ruled, with every heartbeat.
From the thunderous roar of the T-Rex, to the gentle giants grazing the plains,
Their legacy remains, in our dreams, they still reign.
